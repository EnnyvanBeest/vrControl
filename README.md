# vrControl
 Code to operate linear track environments using pre-rendered environments.

Note: this partially depends on functions within RigBox(https://github.com/cortex-lab/Rigbox), especially from the +dat and +hw package directories, and the "burgbox" functions within cb-tools. The dat.paths function must be manually written for each rig. Right now (230104), I'm using a few hacked together pieces, with rigbox's version of +dat and +hw, and some local ones. Probably a bad idea... maybe...
